# Buffer Class Template

## Description
This repository contains a template implementation of a Buffer class in C++. The Buffer class is designed to manage a dynamic memory buffer, allowing for allocation and reallocation of memory for different data types using templates and smart pointers for automatic memory management.

## Features
- Type-agnostic buffer allocation
- Use of `std::shared_ptr` for automatic memory management
- Template class for flexibility with different data types

## Installation
To utilize this Buffer class in your project, simply clone the repository and include `Buffer.hpp` in your project files.


## Usage

The following examples show how to use the Buffer class to allocate memory for different data types.

```cpp
#include "Buffer.hpp"

// Allocate a buffer for integers
Buffer<int> intBuffer;
intBuffer.Allocate(10); // Allocates memory for 10 integers

// Allocate a buffer for floats
Buffer<float> floatBuffer;
floatBuffer.Allocate(20); // Allocates memory for 20 floats
```

## To-Do
- [ ] Implement the `Reallocate` method to allow buffer size changes.
- [ ] Add error handling for memory allocation and reallocation failures.
- [ ] Optimize memory management to prevent memory leaks and reduce fragmentation.
- [ ] Implement additional utility methods such as `Clear` and `Resize`.
- [ ] Write unit tests for each public method of the Buffer class.
- [ ] Set up continuous integration for automated testing.
